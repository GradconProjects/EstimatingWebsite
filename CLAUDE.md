# Gradcon Estimator — instructions for Claude Code

This is Gradcon Concrete Constructions' estimating tool: pick a structural
element from a dropdown, the entire material/reo/formwork/labour catalog
for that element rolls out below it, fill in quantities, and everything
rolls up live into a quote (element → section → grand total → margin
ladder). It's a React + Vite + Tailwind app, built to replace an Excel
workbook that did the same thing with formulas.

Read this whole file before changing anything in `src/lib/costing.js` or
`src/data/catalog.js` — the costing rules below aren't arbitrary, they're
what a real Excel workbook got wrong once and had corrected. Breaking one
of them silently produces a wrong quote, not a crash.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
npm run verify      # re-runs the costing regression checks — do this after ANY change to catalog.js or costing.js
npm run build        # production build
```

`npm run verify` runs `scripts/verify.mjs` in plain Node — no browser, no
build step. It caught two real bugs during development (a duplicate
"Pump" resource key silently overwriting itself, and Trench Mesh/Square
Mesh/Stock Bar being costed off tonnage instead of their catalog $/unit
price). Treat a red `verify` run the same as a broken build.

## Architecture

```
src/
  data/catalog.js       — ALL domain data. No React, no logic. Plain arrays/objects.
  lib/costing.js         — ALL domain logic. Pure functions, no React, no DOM.
  lib/storage.js          — the ONE hook that talks to localStorage.
  components/              — presentation only. Should not contain business rules
                             (a component multiplying qty * rate itself, instead of
                             calling computeElementCost, is a bug waiting to diverge).
  App.jsx                    — composition root: wires storage + costing + components together.
scripts/verify.mjs            — Node-runnable regression checks for lib/costing.js.
```

**Why data/logic/UI are split like this:** `data/catalog.js` and
`lib/costing.js` have zero React or DOM dependency, so they can be
imported directly by plain Node (`scripts/verify.mjs` does exactly this).
That's what makes fast, no-browser regression testing possible. If you
move costing logic into a component (e.g. compute a row's cost inline in
`CategoryBlock.jsx` instead of via `computeElementCost`), you lose that
safety net silently. Keep all cost arithmetic in `lib/costing.js`.

## Costing rules (the part that's easy to get subtly wrong)

1. **Every product in `FULL_CATALOG` is shown on every element type, always.**
   There is no per-element filtering of which categories or products
   apply — that was a deliberate decision (Grady wants to see the whole
   catalog and decide per job what applies, not have the tool guess).
   A blank quantity costs $0 and contributes nothing — that's what makes
   showing the whole catalog on every tab harmless. **Do not add
   per-element-type filtering of catalog rows** without checking that's
   actually what's wanted; it was explicitly requested to be removed once
   already (see git history / prior conversation) after an earlier
   version tried to curate a subset per element type.

2. **Only `PROCESSED BAR` costs off Total Weight, and only `SQUARE MESH`
   costs off Total Area.** Processed Bar's catalog `unitCost` is genuinely
   $/tonne (`weightBasis: true`). Square Mesh's `unitCost` is genuinely
   $/sheet, but the estimator enters **m² of coverage**, not a sheet count
   — `areaBasis: true` tells `computeRowTotal` to cost it as
   `ceil(qty / sheetArea) * unitCost` (sheets are bought whole, so this
   always rounds up; `sheetArea` — 14.4 m², a standard 6.0×2.4m sheet — is
   a per-product catalog/rate field, editable in the Rates modal like
   `unitWeight`). Every other category — including Trench Mesh and Stock
   Bar, which also carry a `unitWeight` — costs as `qty * unitCost`
   directly, because their catalog price is per length/bar, not per tonne;
   that leftover `unitWeight` exists purely so the UI can show informational
   tonnage (useful for delivery planning). **`computeRowTotal` in
   `costing.js` is the ONE place that implements all three rules — always
   call it (from `computeElementCost`, `CategoryBlock.jsx`,
   `PrintQuoteReport.jsx`) rather than recomputing a row total inline
   anywhere else, or the three will eventually disagree.** If you add a new
   weight- or area-priced category, set the matching flag in `catalog.js`.
   If you're unsure whether a category should be `true` on either flag, it
   almost certainly shouldn't be — only Processed Bar and Square Mesh are.

3. **Percentages are fractions, not whole numbers.** `overheadPct: 0.08`
   means 8%, not `8`. A whole-number entry displayed with a `%` format
   but stored as `8` would multiply through as 800%. This bit the
   original Excel workbook once. There's no UI validation preventing
   someone typing `8` instead of `0.08` in the Overheads/Contingency
   inputs right now — if you're touching `QuoteSummary.jsx`, consider
   whether the input should divide by 100 for a more human-friendly "type
   8 for 8%" UX, but if you do, update `computeMarginLadder`'s callers
   consistently (don't have some callers pass fractions and others
   percentages).

4. **The margin ladder divides, it doesn't multiply.** Sell price =
   `subtotal / (1 - margin)`, not `subtotal * (1 + margin)`. A 30% margin
   on cost is not the same number as a 30% markup — this app implements
   margin-on-sell-price (the construction-industry convention Gradcon
   uses), matching the original workbook. See
   `computeMarginLadder` in `costing.js`.

5. **`RESOURCE_COLS` has two entries named "Pump"** (`pump_hr` and
   `pump_m3` — the catalog prices pumping both per hour and per m³ of
   concrete pumped). They're distinguished by `key`, not `name`. Anywhere
   you index labour data by resource, **use `key`, never `name` alone** —
   keying by name was a real bug during development (the `pump_hr`
   column's totals silently went missing because a `{name: column}` map
   only kept the last "Pump" entry). If you add another resource that
   shares a name with an existing one, give it a distinct `key` and check
   `verify.mjs`'s "BOTH Pump columns" test still passes as a pattern to
   follow.

6. **Rate lookups always fall back to the catalog default.** Use
   `lookupRate(rates, key, fallback)` (or the same `rates[key] || fallback`
   pattern) everywhere a rate is read — never index into the `rates`
   object directly and assume the key exists. This matters because a
   user's saved `rates` blob in localStorage predates any future catalog
   additions; a missing key should degrade to the catalog default, not
   render blank/undefined pricing. `verify.mjs` has a test for this
   ("falls back to catalog default rather than $0") — keep it passing.

7. **Concrete delivery fees are auto-applied, per the Holcim schedule.**
   Three CONCRETE rows cost themselves from the element's poured volume
   rather than being typed: **Minimum cartage** (a delivered load under
   `MIN_CARTAGE_THRESHOLD_M3` = 4 m³ is charged $80 per m³ SHORT of 4 —
   *per truck*, so the volume is split into `TRUCK_LOAD_M3` (8 m³) loads
   and only the last, part load can be short), the **production &
   transport surcharge** and the **environment levy** (both flat $/m³ on
   every delivered m³). Typing a Qty on any of those rows takes that row
   fully manual — that's how a known delivery split is priced exactly.
   None of the three count towards `concreteQty` (they're fees, not
   poured volume), and none is charged on the others. See
   `autoMinimumCartage` / `autoConcreteSurcharge` / `autoEnvironmentLevy`
   in `costing.js` — each has exactly ONE implementation, called by
   `computeElementCost`, `CategoryBlock.jsx` and `PrintQuoteReport.jsx`.

8. **Contract minimums bill through `computeRowTotal`.** A product can
   carry a `minQty` (the 7th field in its catalog row) — a "4 hour min"
   pump bills 4 hours for a 1-hour job. `computeRowTotal` raises the
   quantity to `minQty` before any weight/area/length basis applies, and
   only when the row has a quantity at all (a blank row still costs
   nothing). Every CONCRETE PUMPING rate and minimum comes from the
   supplier's schedule and is editable in the Rates modal.

9. **GST is hardcoded at 10%** (`GST_RATE` in `catalog.js`). This is an
   Australian tool. If this is ever adapted for another market, that's
   the one place to change — but check every place `GST_RATE` or `* 1.1`
   is used (currently just `computeMarginLadder`).

## How to extend

- **Add a new material product:** add a row to the relevant category's
  `products` array in `catalog.js` — `[name, unit, unitWeight, unitCost]`,
  `unitWeight`/`unitCost` are `null` if not applicable. It will
  automatically appear on every element card and in the Rates modal; no
  other file needs to change.

- **Add a new material category:** add an object to `FULL_CATALOG`
  (`{ key, weightBasis, products }`) — it renders automatically via the
  `FULL_CATALOG.map(...)` in `ElementCard.jsx`. Decide `weightBasis`
  carefully — see rule 2 above.

- **Add a new element type (tab):** add an entry to `ELEMENT_TYPES` in
  `catalog.js` with a `category` (the broad, foldable group shown as
  optgroups in the Add-Element dropdown and as the outer fold in
  QuoteSummary — e.g. `FOUNDATIONS`, `SUSPENDED STRUCTURE`), a `section`
  (the finer sub-group nested under category in QuoteSummary — existing
  or new), and a `labour` key pointing at one of the `LABOUR_TEMPLATES`
  (or a new one, if the task sequence genuinely differs — e.g.
  ground-bearing slabs pour blinding and lay poly; suspended slabs prop
  and strip formwork instead; excavation-only elements don't pour
  concrete at all). Both `category` and `section` are required — `npm run
  verify` fails an entry missing either. Keep new entries in roughly
  ground-up construction order in the array (earthworks → foundations →
  retention → substructure → vertical structure → suspended structure →
  external/landscape → pool → civil) — that order is what the dropdown
  and summary display, and it's meaningful to an estimator scanning the
  list. `ELEMENT_TYPES` is deliberately comprehensive — every
  concrete/structural element Gradcon might meet across any building or
  civil project, not curated per job (see rule 1).

- **Add a new labour resource:** add to `RESOURCE_COLS` with a unique
  `key`. It appears as a new column in every element's Labour/Equipment
  matrix and in the Rates modal automatically.

- **Change default prices:** edit the `unitCost`/`unitWeight` values
  directly in `catalog.js`. Note this only changes what a *fresh install*
  seeds — a user who has already opened the Rates modal and edited a
  price has that override saved in `localStorage` under `gradcon-rates`,
  which takes precedence (see `lookupRate`). There's currently no "reset
  to catalog defaults" button; add one if that's needed (clear the
  relevant key from the stored rates object).

## Multi-project dashboard

The app has two views, switched in `App.jsx` by whether `activeId` points
at a project: the **Dashboard** (`components/Dashboard.jsx`) lists every
project with a live-computed summary row (direct cost, sell at the default
margin, $/m², element count) and a portfolio-wide totals footer; opening
one renders `ProjectEditor`, the original single-quote UI, scoped to that
project's own storage key. `lib/projects.js` holds a lightweight index —
`{ id, storageKey, createdAt }` per project — under `PROJECTS_INDEX_KEY`;
everything else (name, date, GFA, items) lives in the project's own quote
object, read via `readQuote`/`readQuotes`. An install that predates
multi-project support (a single quote under the old fixed `gradcon-quote`
key) auto-migrates into project #1 the first time the index loads empty —
see `migrateLegacyQuote`.

## Optional Supabase backend

`lib/storage.js`'s `useStoredState` — the one hook every piece of
persisted state goes through — transparently backs onto Supabase (a
single `estimator_kv(key, value, updated_at)` table, see
`supabase/migrations/0001_estimator_kv.sql`) when
`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`/`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set, and falls back to
per-browser `localStorage` otherwise. This is exactly the "network-backed
implementation swapped in without touching any component" the hook's
`[value, setValue, status]` signature was originally kept generic for.
Components never check which backend is active. Both the Supabase load
and save paths are wrapped in `try/catch` — a network failure (not just an
API-level error) must still resolve `status` to `"error"`, never leave it
hung on `"loading"` forever (App.jsx blocks rendering on the projects
index finishing its load).

`lib/supabaseClient.js` reads the client only from env vars — never
hardcode a URL or key. `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` must be the
anon/publishable key; the secret/service_role key bypasses every RLS
policy and must never ship in client code. See `.env.example`.

## PDF / print export

The "Print / PDF" button in `ProjectEditor` calls `window.print()`; the
browser's own print-to-PDF handles the export, no library needed. What
prints is **not** the on-screen editable UI — `components/PrintQuoteReport.jsx`
is a standalone report, hidden on screen and shown only under
`@media print` (via Tailwind's `print:` variant), built straight from
`computeElementCost`. Two reasons it's separate rather than just revealing
the existing cards: (1) collapsed `ElementCard`/`CategoryBlock` sections
are conditionally unmounted, not just visually hidden, so CSS alone can't
print their contents regardless of on-screen collapse state; (2) printing
the full catalog (114 products per element) would be useless — the report
lists only lines with a quantity entered. The rest of the editor gets
`print:hidden` (see `App.jsx`). `@page` sizing lives in `index.css`.

## Self-service element types (Element Types modal)

`ELEMENT_TYPES` in `catalog.js` stays a static, code-reviewed list — but
Grady can add his own element types from the app itself via the "Element
Types" button (`components/ManageElementTypesModal.jsx`), so a new job
that needs an element type nobody's coded yet doesn't have to wait on a
code change. Custom types are stored separately under
`gradcon-custom-element-types` (`{id, category, section, name, labour}`,
same shape as a built-in entry, `labour` restricted to the existing
`LABOUR_TEMPLATES` keys) and merged with the built-ins at render time in
`App.jsx` (`allElementTypes`/`allCategoryOrder`/`allSectionOrder`), which
is what actually gets threaded down to `AddElementBar`, `QuoteSummary` and
`PrintQuoteReport` as props — `data/catalog.js` itself is never written to.
If you add a new prop-consuming place that needs the element list, take
`elementTypes`/`categoryOrder` as props with the built-in exports as
defaults, the way those three components do, rather than importing
`ELEMENT_TYPES` directly.

## Estimates → Quotes import bridge

The separate "Estimates" tool (Gradcon Element Takeoff Engine, embedded
in the combined portal) computes generic quantities — a bar diameter +
length, a concrete grade + volume — that don't line up 1:1 with Quotes'
named catalog SKUs. "Publish to Quote" in that tool writes its live
Quantity Register (`{project, lines}`, i.e. its own `allLines()` output)
to `localStorage["gradcon-estimate-export"]` and asks the portal shell to
switch to the Quotes app; `App.jsx` picks that up on load, runs it through
`lib/estimateImport.js`'s `buildImportFromEstimate`, and creates a new
project from the result. That function is deliberately conservative: it
only prefills a catalog quantity where the match is unambiguous (an exact
element-type match, a bar diameter that exists in Processed Bar, a
concrete grade with exactly one product, wall formwork against the one
"Walls" product) and pushes a plain-English flag onto `quote.importFlags`
for everything else (ambiguous concrete mixes, formwork it can't
identify, element types Quotes has no equivalent for, trench mesh — see
the file's comments for why that last one can't auto-map even though it
reuses Square Mesh's SL/RL codes). `ImportFlagsBanner.jsx` shows those
flags once, on the freshly-created project; dismissing just clears
`quote.importFlags`. Extend `ESTIMATE_TYPE_MAP` there (not `catalog.js`)
if Estimates gains an element type Quotes already has a match for.

## Known limitations, on purpose (not oversights)

- **No auth, even with Supabase configured.** The `estimator_kv` RLS
  policy allows the anon key to read/write every row — this matches the
  app's original "no login" design, just shared across devices instead of
  confined to one browser, not a security boundary. Anyone with the URL
  and the anon key can edit any project's rates and quotes. Fine for a
  single-team internal tool; tighten the policy (require `auth.uid()`) if
  this ever needs real per-user accounts.
- **No undo.** Every edit is immediate and only reversible by hand
  (or duplicating an element before making risky changes to it).

## Design conventions

- Tailwind utility classes throughout, no CSS-in-JS. Palette: `neutral-*`
  for structure, `blue-950`/`blue-9xx` for the "blueprint navy" header
  chrome, `orange-*` (safety/hi-vis) for money figures and primary
  actions, `amber-*` for the labour matrix (visually distinct from
  material sections). Numbers are `font-mono tabular-nums` throughout so
  columns of figures align — keep that convention for any new numeric
  display.
- Every material/labour input is a controlled `<input type="number">`
  via the shared `NumInput` component (`components/atoms.jsx`) — reuse
  it rather than writing a new number input, it already handles the
  "empty string vs. 0" distinction correctly (an empty cell means "not
  entered", not "zero").
- Category blocks and the whole element card are independently
  collapsible — this was a deliberate response to "the full catalog on
  every tab is a lot of rows"; don't remove the ability to collapse in
  the name of simplifying the DOM.

## Verifying a change before calling it done

1. `npm run verify` — must pass.
2. `npm run dev` and manually add one of each element-type "shape"
   (an excavation-type, a footing-type, a wall-type, a slab-type) and
   confirm quantities still roll up into the sticky total and the Quote
   Summary rail, folded under the right category and section.
3. If you touched `computeElementCost` or `computeMarginLadder`, add a
   new case to `scripts/verify.mjs` covering it before merging — that
   file is the project's only regression net and should grow with the
   logic, not stay static.
4. If you touched the Dashboard or multi-project flow: create a second
   project, add different elements to each, and confirm the Dashboard's
   per-row totals and "All projects" footer match what each project's own
   Quote Summary shows.
