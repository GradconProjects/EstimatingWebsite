// Crew-sheet columns, in the order they read on Gradcon's labour sheet:
// the three 3+-person crews first, then plant, pump (hr AND m³ — distinct
// keys, see CLAUDE.md rule 5), crane. `crew: true` marks the minimum-crew
// columns; they count CREW-days (a whole crew booked for a day), so their
// rates are PER CREW: Concrete Crew 3 men, Steel Crew 5 men, General Labour
// 3 men. Plant stays per unit-day; pumping is $10/m³ plus $250/hr.
// The crew units are "crew-day" (not "day") ON PURPOSE: the per-crew rates
// replaced per-person rates saved in existing installs under the old
// name+"day" keys, and the changed unit retires those stale overrides —
// lookupRate falls back to these new catalog defaults (CLAUDE.md rule 6).
// A concrete order under this volume (per element/pour) attracts the
// catalog's "Minimum cartage" automatically — see autoMinimumCartage in
// lib/costing.js. Typed values on the Minimum cartage row always win.

// Holcim (Melbourne Metro & Mornington Peninsula) service-fee schedule,
// effective 1 May 2026: the fee applies where a DELIVERED LOAD is under
// 4.0 m³, and is charged on the undelivered part of that load — i.e.
// (4.0 - load) x $80/m³, per truck, not on the order total. An 11 m³ order
// delivered 7+4 attracts nothing; delivered 8+3 the second truck is 1 m³
// short, so $80. Quotes hold a total volume rather than a delivery
// schedule, so the engine splits it into whole truck loads of
// TRUCK_LOAD_M3 and charges the shortfall on the last (part) load — the
// realistic worst case. Both figures are editable (the truck size in the
