// Crew-sheet columns, in the order they read on Gradcon's labour sheet:
// the three 3+-person crews first, then plant, pump (hr AND m³ — distinct
// keys, see CLAUDE.md rule 5), crane. `crew: true` marks the minimum-crew
// columns; they count CREW-days (a whole crew booked for a day), so their
// rates are PER CREW: Concrete Crew 3 men, Steel Crew 5 men, General Labour
// 3 men. Plant stays per unit-day; pumping is $10/m³ plus $250/hr.
// The crew units are "crew-day" (not "day") ON PURPOSE: the per-crew rates
// replaced per-person rates saved in existing installs under the old
// name+"day" keys, and the changed unit retires those stale overrides —
// lookupRate falls back to these new catalog defaults (CLAUDE.md rule 6).
// A concrete order under this volume (per element/pour) attracts the
// catalog's "Minimum cartage" automatically — see autoMinimumCartage in
// lib/costing.js. Typed values on the Minimum cartage row always win.
//
// MINIMUM CARTAGE. The poured volume is divided by this minimum load size
// into whole loads and the REMAINDER of that division — a part load — is
// charged $80 for every m³ it falls short of it: 11 m³ is 2 loads + 3 m³,
// so 1 m³ short, $80; 12 m³ divides evenly and costs nothing. This figure
// is BOTH the divisor and the minimum.
//
// It is only the fallback: the live value is the editable "Minimum cartage
// load size" production rate (see PRODUCTION_RATES below), so a supplier
// working to a different minimum is a rate edit, not a code change. The

 *              area.
 * volumeRateBasis: true means Qty is entered as a REINFORCEMENT RATE in

 *              ({concreteM3}) that every caller builds with rowContext(item).
 *              Only REINFORCEMENT BY RATE works this way. An element with no

 * broad, foldable grouping (Foundations, Suspended Structure, ...) shown
 * on the Add-Element dropdown; `section` is the finer sub-group used by
 * the Quote Summary rail. Keep the array in roughly ground-up construction
 * order (earthworks → foundations → retention → substructure → vertical
 * structure → suspended structure → external/landscape → pool → civil)
 * since that's meaningful to an estimator scanning the list, not
 * arbitrary. See CLAUDE.md → "How to extend" before adding to this list.
