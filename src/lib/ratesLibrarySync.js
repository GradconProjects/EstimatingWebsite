/**
 * Rates Library → Quotes price sync.
 *
 * The Rates Library (portal/rates-library.html) is Gradcon's authoritative
 * price list. Cost Planner already reads it live and Estimates reads its
 * global block, but Quotes historically kept its own independent copy seeded
 * from data/catalog.js — so editing a price in the library changed nothing on
 * an element card, which is exactly the disagreement that had conventional
 * formwork at $60 in one place and $150 in the other.
 *
 * This closes that gap WITHOUT throwing away deliberate Quotes edits:
 *
 *   - a Quotes rate still equal to its catalog default is unowned → the
 *     library's price is taken;
 *   - a Quotes rate equal to the value this sync last wrote is still owned by
 *     the library → a later library edit flows through too;
 *   - anything else was typed by an estimator in the Rates modal → left
 *     alone. The modal's drift banner shows it and offers a one-click restore.
 *
 * The last-written values live under LIB_SYNC_KEY so the second rule survives
 * a reload. Matching is by product NAME and only where exactly one catalog
 * product carries it — the library's stored shape is {name: {cost}} with no
 * unit, so an ambiguous name is skipped rather than guessed at.
