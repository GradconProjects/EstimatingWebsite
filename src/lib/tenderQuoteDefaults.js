/**
 * Standard boilerplate + seeding for the Tender Quote (see components/
 * TenderQuoteReport.jsx) — a direct copy of Gradcon's real quotation
 * document (7 Double Creek Road, Flinders — QUOTATION Rev.1), transcribed
 * verbatim so the seeded text is Gradcon's actual known-good standard
 * wording. These are only DEFAULTS: once seeded they live in
 * quote.tenderQuote and every field is freely editable per project.
 *
 * Line items are seeded from the project's own elements — the price from
 * each element's share of the real sell price (computeExternalScopeLines),
 * the dot points from the element's published estimating quantities
 * (concrete m³, reinforcement t, formwork m², mesh m² — the figures that
 * came across from the Estimates tab). Reseeding never runs over a tender
 * the estimator has already edited unless they ask for it.

export const TENDER_CONTRACTUAL_CONDITIONS = `1) Allowances:
   a. Concrete:
      All material allowances are derived from minimum sizes and dimensions given in the structural drawings. Slabs requiring deeper beams will require additional concrete at blinding rate.
   b. Formwork:
      Additional formwork required for an elevated slab will incur additional costs unless clearly noted on the quote (i.e. deepened edge beams etc). This price includes a maximum 400mm edge form set up.

2) Additional Costs:
   a. Fill:
      Additional sand required to fill sites will be charged $65.00 per m3 + GST.
   b. Blinding:
      The supply of any blinding concrete due to collapsing ground conditions or increased beam depth required to achieve founding depth will be charged at $365.00 per m3 + GST which covers excavation, labour and concrete. (It does not include a pump. If a pump is required, an invoice will be supplied).
   c. Variations:
      Variations can be quoted and agreed upon. Alternatively, all variations will be Cost + 20% margin + GST. A detailed cost report will be provided for review.
   d. Stand down time:
      Stand down time due to delays by builder or other trades will be charged out at $85.00/hr + GST per man and $120.00/hr + GST per machine for plant hire.

3) Safety:
   a. Safety Caps:
      Safety Caps will be provided by Gradcon for all bars posing as hazardous. Caps are to be stored onsite and will be collected once their use is complete. Please advise if and when there are not required.
   b. Handrails:
      Safety handrails associated with formwork will be supplied by Gradcon - Note these temporary handrails will be removed once Gradcon's works have been completed.
   c. Deep Excavation:
      Gradcon has no allowances for safety barriers or shoring associated with deep excavation.
   d. Other:
      Refer to OHS/Insurances section of quotation for other particulars.

4) Site conditions:
   a. Builder is to ensure Gradcon is provided with updated drawings immediately they are issued.
   b. Builder to ensure a suitable access is available for vehicles (crushed rock road base or similar).
   c. Builder to ensure that the site has a toilet.
   d. Builder to ensure that the site has power available.
   e. Builder to ensure that the site has water available.
   f. Builder to ensure that all previous services have been disconnected.
   g. Setout and surveying to be done by the builder including building perimeter (concrete profile) and the location of steps, set downs and rebates.
   h. A bin is to be provided for the excess material generated from the works. If bin is not provided a neat pile of rubbish will be left on site.
   i. Water Control - The builder is, to the best of their ability, to provide a site that assists with surface water control (i.e. cut off drains).

5) Building & Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2002:
   a. At Gradcon's sole discretion, if there are any disputes or claims for unpaid Services, the provisions of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2002 may apply.
   b. Nothing in this agreement is intended to have the effect of contracting out of any applicable provisions of the Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment Act 2002 of Victoria, except to the extent permitted by the Act where applicable.

6) Quote Conditions:
   a. This quotation is valid for 30 days from date provided on the quote and may be subject to prices rises after that period. Please note that due to the current volatility of pricing & supply of steel reinforcement and concrete, this quotation has a strict validity period of 30 days from time of quotation to commencement of works. Should works not commence within 30 days of this quotation, we reserve the right to review, and if necessary, pass on any increases incurred beyond the validity period.
   b. The quotation is not to have retentions held against it. Unless Agreed to.
   c. Unless "for construction" documents are provided at time of tender, all quotes will subject to review upon final documentation being issued.

7) OHS/Insurances:
   a. Work Cover Insurance Policy. Certificate of Currency provided on request.
   b. Public liability of $20,000,000.00. Certificate of Currency provided on request.
   c. All employees have a current White Card.
   d. Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS) provided as required.
   e. All employees will wear Hi-Vis clothing and hard hats when required.
   f. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) provided on request.`;
